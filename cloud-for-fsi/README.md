The Microsoft (MS) Cloud for Financial Services Industry (FSI) Policy Portfolio's Policy Initiatives aid in customizing deployments to reduce the time needed to audit environments and help meet established regulatory compliance frameworks and FSI customer requirements.

Microsoft Cloud for FSI makes several custom policy initiatives accessible through this repository. The policy initiatives and files contained in this repository are intended to serve as a starting point to map such requirements to an Azure implementation. Please note that these files are not intended to be final or comprehensive solutions, but rather a helpful resource to jumpstart your efforts.

**Important**- Organizations are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The information provided in this document and repository does not constitute legal advice, and organizations should consult their legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory compliance.

The evidence against each security measure and its corresponding security controls shall be assessed to determine whether it meets the security requirements. If the security requirements are not fulfilled, the outstanding risks shall be identified. The SAA and/or NCSP shall identify any additional security measures and controls needed to attain an acceptable residual risk, which would be implemented by the NCSP and/or CSP.

**Note**- These policies may help you assess compliance with the control; however, there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such, Compliant in Azure Policy refers only to the policy definitions themselves; this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between compliance domains, controls, and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance standard may change over time. To view the change history, see the GitHub Commit History.

## Shared responsibility and customer responsibilities

To ensure your data is secure and your privacy controls are addressed, we recommend that you follow a set of best practices when deploying into Azure:

- [Azure security best practices and patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/best-practices-and-patterns)
- [Microsoft Services in Cybersecurity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/services-technologies)
  
Protecting your data also requires that all aspects of your security and compliance programs include your cloud infrastructure and data. The above guidance can help you to secure your deployment.
