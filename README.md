# Industry Policy Portfolio
The Industry Policy Portfolio seeks to help industry specific organizations in sectors like government, public sector, finance and others accelerate digital transformation and achieve better business outcomes, specifically by creating Policy Initiatives that aid in customizing deployments to reduce the time needed to audit environments and help meet established regulatory compliance frameworks and government requirements.

The portfolio contains built-in and custom Azure policy initiatives accessible through this repository.

For **built-in** policy initiatives, there is a link provided to the Azure Policy blade where you can assign the policy to your tenant or resource directly. 

For **custom** policy initiatives, the Deploy to Azure button can be utilized to make the policy initiative available for your environment to then be assigned to a specific tenant or resource. 

**Important** - Organizations are wholly responsible for ensuring their own compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The information provided in this document and repository does not constitute legal advice, and organizations should consult their legal advisors for any questions regarding regulatory compliance.

The evidence against each security measure and its corresponding security controls shall be assessed to determine whether it meets the security requirements. If the security requirements are not fulfilled, the outstanding risks shall be identified. The SAA and/or NCSP shall identify any additional security measures and controls needed to attain an acceptable residual risk, which would be implemented by the NCSP and/or CSP.

**Note** - These policies may help you assess compliance with the control; however, there often is not a one-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. As such, Compliant in Azure Policy refers only to the policy definitions themselves; this doesn't ensure you're fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, the compliance standard includes controls that aren't addressed by any Azure Policy definitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial view of your overall compliance status. The associations between compliance domains, controls, and Azure Policy definitions for this compliance standard may change over time. To view the change history, see the GitHub Commit History.

## Shared responsibility and customer responsibilities

To ensure your data is secure and your privacy controls are addressed, we recommend that you follow a set of best practices when deploying into Azure:

- [Azure security best practices and patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/best-practices-and-patterns)
- [Microsoft Services in Cybersecurity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/services-technologies)
  
Protecting your data also requires that all aspects of your security and compliance programs include your cloud infrastructure and data. The above guidance can help you to secure your deployment.
